Please put issues in this directory, in Markdown format, with the first line being a plain text line
which simply has the title for the issue.

Please prefix each issue with a "logical number" that groups it together with other issues that are similar, and places in the issues in a "sensible order"; this is the order
that will be used when they go on the Kanban board.

See /team02 and /team03 for an example.
